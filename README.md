# Bayesian Probability Distribution Generator

bayes.ipynb takes a string of 1's and 0's, corresponding to a given event occurring or not occuring. From this, it generates a probability distribution of true probabilities to a granularity specified by the bucketNum parameter. It can also give scores to an inputted prediction probability based on adherence to the calculated probability distribution.
